Where are you? Where are you?
…was the call of the father ringing out to the first man, Adam. He had been given dominion over everything and all that roamed the face of the earth. “Surely the lion didn’t have him for a meal”, God thought to himself. Surely the twigs haven’t subdued him, enclosing him in a cage so hard to escape. Where is my man?
Could anything upon the whole earth hide the man?
You guessed right, just one piece of creation could hide him. Himself. Only the man could hide himself.

> “Only one piece of creation could hide him. Himself”

But why would he hide himself God pondered. Aha, did he eat of the tree I asked him not to? There’s no way he did that right?

There is much knowledge, numerous techniques, and ongoing research, all looking into the wonderful works of the father. Amid all these, there’s you, the man, the woman that God has made. He has put all the things under your feet. He has made you a prince and ruler over all that the earth has to offer. When he comes to visit, will he find you ruling with your head up high over all that exists, or will he find you hiding? Will he say, “there you are”, or will he say, “where are you?”

# The Bamboozled Doctor

When Dr. Bamboozle heard the “the Jews seek a sign” he at once knew what he had to do. He ran upon the wings of science to preach Christ crucified. They saw the science (signs) and were drawn to him but then they came and met with Christ. 
Dr. Bamboozle spends his regular day working on Marizmo species bacteria to investigate host-pathogen interactions at Mildale University’s Crismo laboratories. When not in the lab or teaching, he passes his time taking a meditative walk. He claims that each stride reminds him that there is more to find in Christ.

# Now you see me, now you don’t

That was what Jesus told His disciples as His crucifixion was approaching. They had enjoyed a rich relationship for 3 years and it was coming to an end.
However, they weren't going to be left alone! He left them with the most important tool of all, the Holy Spirit. Calling Him a tool is a huge stretch, because he is the Spirit of God, the one who breathes life into all things.
