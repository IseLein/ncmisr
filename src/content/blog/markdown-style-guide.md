Where are you? Where are you?
…was the call of the father ringing out to the first man, Adam. He had been given dominion over everything and all that roamed the face of the earth. “Surely the lion didn’t have him for a meal”, God thought to himself. Surely the twigs haven’t subdued him, enclosing him in a cage so hard to escape. Where is my man?
Could anything upon the whole earth hide the man?
You guessed right, just one piece of creation could hide him. Himself. Only the man could hide himself.
“Only one piece of creation could hide him. Himself”
But why would he hide himself God pondered. Aha, did he eat of the tree I asked him not to? There’s no way he did that right?

There is much knowledge, numerous techniques, and ongoing research, all looking into the wonderful works of the father. Amid all these, there’s you, the man, the woman that God has made. He has put all the things under your feet. He has made you a prince and ruler over all that the earth has to offer. When he comes to visit, will he find you ruling with your head up high over all that exists, or will he find you hiding? Will he say, “there you are”, or will he say, “where are you?”
